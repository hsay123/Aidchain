# 🌍 AidChain  

> **Transparent, Efficient, and Trusted Aid Delivery** 🚀  

AidChain is a **Stellar-based platform** designed to revolutionize financial aid distribution for NGOs and governments.  
By leveraging **programmable wallets** and **stablecoins**, it ensures aid is delivered **faster, cheaper, and more transparently**.  

💡 *Our mission: Financial access for everyone, everywhere.*

## 💔 The Problem: Why Aid is Broken  

- **High Costs** → $200 transfers average **6.4% in fees** (World Bank, 2023/24)  
- **Poor Traceability** → Weak tracking leads to leakages & reduced accountability  
- **Slow Delivery** → Delays in humanitarian relief can cost lives  

---

## ✨ Our Solution: A Stellar-Powered Platform  

- ⚡ **Minimizing Fees** → Near-zero transaction costs (50,000 payouts ≈ $0.25 total)  
- ✅ **Ensuring Transparency** → Immutable audit trail on the Stellar ledger  
- ⏱ **Fast Delivery** → Instant disbursements via Stellar Disbursement Platform  
- 🔒 **Secure & Compliant** → Trustlines, authorization flags, clawback functionality

## 🛠 Platform Features  

### 📱 Beneficiary & Vendor Apps  
- **Beneficiary Wallet (APK)**  
  - Receive funds instantly  
  - View balance & transaction history  
  - Cash-out to bank/UPI  
  - Redeem aid tokens via QR  

- **Vendor App/POS**  
  - Accept tokens  
  - Instant settlement for goods & services  

### 📊 Dashboards  
- **Admin Dashboard** → Manage onboarding, disbursements, program rules, analytics  
- **Audit Dashboard** → Full traceability + reconciliation reports  

---

## 🔄 How It Works  

1. **Onboarding & KYC** → NGOs register, beneficiaries verified  
2. **Issuance** → Funders deposit fiat → Stablecoin (e.g., USDC) minted on Stellar  
3. **Distribution** → Bulk payouts via Stellar Disbursement Platform  
4. **Redemption** → Spend at merchants or cash-out to fiat  
5. **Audit** → Public transaction IDs for tamper-proof verification

## 🏗 Technical Architecture  

- **User Layer** → NGO, Beneficiary, Vendor, Auditor dashboards  
- **Application Layer** → AidChain backend, API gateway, off-chain KYC DB  
- **Blockchain Layer** → Stellar network (issuer/distributor accounts, trustlines, on/off-ramps)
